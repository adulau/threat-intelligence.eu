While developing various open-source tools in the threat intelligence field (e.g., [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/) and [cve-search](https://www.cve-search.org/)), we noticed the lack of a central place that brings together open standards, documents, methodologies, and processes.  

To address this, we created [threat-intelligence.eu](https://www.threat-intelligence.eu) as an aggregated repository of such resources.

Contributions are very welcome! If youâ€™d like to help, you can open an issue or submit a pull request on the [GitHub repository of threat-intelligence.eu](https://github.com/adulau/threat-intelligence.eu).  
We are especially interested in contributions related to [open standards](https://fsfe.org/activities/os/def.en.html).

# Conference

Each year, the team behind [threat-intelligence.eu](https://www.threat-intelligence.eu) takes part in the [hack.lu](https://hack.lu) conference.  
These events provide an opportunity to exchange knowledge, present our work, and engage with the broader threat intelligence community.
