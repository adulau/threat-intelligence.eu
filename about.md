Whilst designing various open source tools in the threat intelligence field (e.g. [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/), [cve-search](https://www.cve-search.org/)), we couldn't find a simple repository listing
all of the open standards, documents, methodologies and processes in one place. We decided to aggregate the information in one place called [threat-intelligence.eu](https://www.threat-intelligence.eu).

If you want to contribute to the repository, feel free to open an issue or a pull-request on [GitHub repository of threat-intelligence.eu](https://github.com/adulau/threat-intelligence.eu). We are especially keen on contributions about [open standards](https://fsfe.org/activities/os/def.en.html).
